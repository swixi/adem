# adem

Takes a sum of monomials of Steenrod squares and applies the Adem relations (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AdemRelations.html) to each summand. Thus, adem.py outputs a sum of monomials that are written with respect to the Serre-Cartan basis for the Steenrod algebra, also known as "admissible form".

The code is based on that in https://github.com/swixi/steenrod, but simplified and "Python-ized".
